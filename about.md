## Drum vs Toner {#drum-vs-toner}

Many customers ask about the difference between drum units and toner cartridges:

| Component | Function | Lifespan |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Toner Cartridge** | Contains the toner powder that creates the image | 1,000-10,000 pages depending on model |
| **Drum Unit** | Transfers toner to paper using static electricity | 3-4x longer than toner cartridge |

Some printers (like most HP and Canon models) have the drum built into the toner cartridge. Others (like Brother) have separate units that need to be replaced independently.

::: tip Save Money
Replacing only the toner when needed (instead of the whole drum unit) can save you significant money over time.
